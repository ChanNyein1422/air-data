# Air Pollution Data Analysis in Thailand

This repository contains an analysis of air pollution data for cities across Thailand. The study aims to explore the impact of geographical factors, weather conditions, and other environmental variables on the levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other air quality metrics. The analysis leverages machine learning models and statistical methods to identify patterns and predict air quality trends, with a particular focus on the Songkran period.

## Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset includes hourly air quality data for various cities in Thailand, including PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3, NO2, SO2, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
- **Objective**: To identify the factors influencing air pollution levels and to develop predictive models for air quality forecasting.
- **Hypotheses**:
  1. Coastal cities and Higher elevation have lower PM2.5 levels due to better pollutant dispersion from sea breezes and better air circulation.
  2. Wind speed and rainfall affect PM2.5 dispersion and settling.
